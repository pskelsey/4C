# Crop Connectivity under Climate Change (4C model)

## Basic overview
A desktop app for performing climate change risk assessments in real crop locations in Great Britain. 
* Build your own risk model in a few easy clicks.
* Choose a crop species distribution to apply it in, or generate your own.
* Select a climate variable, a future time-period and month, and pick your greenhouse gas emissions scenario.
* Define the level of connectivity among crop locations, if desired.
* Hit the run button, visualise your results, and save them to create your own graphics. 

## Example
A risk function is selected from the drop-down menu and fit to some data for the proportion of plants infected as a function of temperature. You could just as easily recreate the same risk function without any data.

Temperature is selected as the variable of interest, for a low emissions scenario in the 2040s, and the model is applied in potato crops in the English Midlands (map shown). In order to weight the final results by the connectivity of the crops (e.g., for pest dispersal), dispersal is switched on and set to a 2D Gaussian dispersal function with an average dispersal distance of 10km. The boxplots show the distribution of projected values for May through to September, which in this instance, show the percentage increase in risk compared to the current (baseline) climate.

## Motivation
This app was developed so that anybody can perform a state-of-the-art climate change risk assessment. Many scientists have no modelling experience but want to realise the future implications of their experimental results. Many people working in, e.g., planning and development, the agriculture sector, or environment agenices have no data and no modelling experience, but still have questions regarding the likelihood of climate change impacts in GB. The app brings together real crop / land-use data from [IACS](https://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/direct-support/iacs_en), [JACS](http://www.gov.scot/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Agriculture-Fisheries/PubFinalResultsJuneCensus), and [CROME](https://data.gov.uk/data/search?q=CROME), and [UKCP09](http://ukclimateprojections.metoffice.gov.uk/21678) spatially coherent probabilistic climate change data, all under one roof. Selecting what you want is just a matter of hitting a few switches and twiddling a few knobs. I've used this framework to produce several peer-reviewed journal articles, and you can too. 

### Installation and loading
NOTE: Due to the many controls and features of the app, the GUI is a fixed size (12") and not 'responsive,' i.e., it will not scale to fit the screen of your device. This means it may not be suitable for devices with smaller screens and is best suited for desktop PCs. 
Use the 'Clone or download' button to obtain the executable file. This will open up a web-based installer so you will need an internet connection. The installer will download MATLAB Runtime, which is a free standalone set of shared libraries that enables the execution of compiled MATLAB applications on computers that do not have MATLAB installed. MATLAB Runtime requires approximately 1GB of disk space, so it may take some time to install. Once installation is complete, the app will load quickly using the desktop shortcut. When you are finished with using the app you can uninstall MATLAB Runtime, or you can keep it in order to download and use other MATLAB apps and components. Note that when you run the app after installation, a splash screen will appear to let you know the app is loading. The splash screen will disappear also immediately and there will be a short interval before the app loads; there is no need to try and load it again, just be patient.
