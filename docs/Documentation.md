## Background
The app uses gridded crop distribution / land use data and gridded climate change data, and allows you to build a model to apply in selected grid cells under various climate change scenarios. 
allows you to define a weather-dependent model, or fit one to your own data. The model will then be driven by spatially coherent, probabilistic climate change data in order to project future values under climate change. This means that for each grid cell you will get an 'ensemble' or distribution of results that represent the uncertainty in potential future changes in climate. You can select which land cells to apply the model in by choosing a crop distribution or land use type, and a region of Great Britain. The app will then produce a 'super-ensemble' of results, where the distribution of outcomes for selected grid cells are combined. You can also choose to incorporate dispersal among grid cells into your projections if required.  

The risk model must be a function of one weather variable only, y = f(x); e.g., crop damage as a function of temperature, infection risk as a function of precipitation, etc. The ability to build models containing more than one weather variable will be included in a future release. 

uses 25 km gridded data  defining the spatial distribution of various crop species and land use types in Scotland and England, and spatially coherent, probabilistic climate change data to project the future connectivity of selected grid cells under climate change.
